## Background
Recommender System is a system that predict ratings or preferences user may give to this item. It is a method to recommend things to people based on their past behaviour. We often sort or present as "top-N" recommendations which means recommendating people a set of N items from a large collection of items. In this project, we use Apache Spark SparkMLib(ALS) and deep learning to build recommender systems which can provide recommendations to a user.

## Dataset
This data come from [Kaggle MovieLen](https://www.kaggle.com/snehal1409/movielens). 

It contains 671 user, 9125 movies and 100004 ratings and there are no missing values in `ratings.csv` and `movies.csv`. The range of rating is between 0.5 and 5 and most user give score 3 or 4.

|   |userId	|movieId |rating	|timestamp |
|:-:|:-----:|:------:|:------:|:--------:|
|0	|1	    |31	     |2.5     |1260759144|
|1	|1	    |1029	   |3.0     |1260759179|
|2	|1	    |1061	   |3.0     |1260759182|

## Methodology
In this project, we utilize two algorithms to build model which are ALS and deep leraning. In terms of ALS algorithm, it is a popular algorithm whihc is implemented in [Apache Spark ML](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.ml.recommendation.ALS.html#pyspark.ml.recommendation.ALS) and built for a larges-scale collaborative filtering problems. So, we consider to use the method in this dataset. For the deep learning algorithm, we use [Keras](https://keras.io/) to construct network. In this project, we only tune the rank parameter in ALS alogrithm, if we consider hyperparameter or different topologies toward both methods, the results may be different.

## Results
For the userID 474, different algorithms provide different recommendations. The results as following,
